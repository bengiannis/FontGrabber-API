# FontGrabber API

FontGrabber is a web application that allows users to paste any URL and retrieve the font files used on that website. This repository contains the backend code for the FontGrabber application.

The API uses Puppeteer, a headless Chromium browser that scrapes a given site's fonts by reading its stylesheets.

While the FontGrabber website has now sunsetted, the backend code is still available here for reference, learning, and potential reuse under the MIT License.
